            I'm Niklas, a curious software developer based in UmeÃ¥, Sweden.
            With over 4 years of experience, Ive been on a journey of crafting
            modern web applications and creating user-friendly interfaces that
            are enjoyed by tens of thousands of users each month.

            One of my proudest accomplishments was leading a project to
            introduce Typescript into a collaborative codebase, where we boosted
            scalability, improved the developer experience, and elevated code
            quality. It was like giving our codebase a supercharge!

            At ComeOn Group, I am part of a fantastic team that built a
            top-notch sports betting application from the ground up, saving the
            company millions by transitioning from a third-party solution. Our
            hard work paid off, resulting in a more stable and competitive
            product.

                  Led an initiative to implement Typescript into a collaborative
                  codebase, resulting in significant improvements in
                  scalability, developer experience, and code quality. This
                  initiative notably reduced the occurrence of critical bugs,
                  and substantial increase in overall product stability and it
                  played a pivotal role in ensuring the quality of our sports
                  betting application.

                  I collaborated closely with my team of developers to launch a
                  large-scale sports betting application running, resulting in
                  notable cost savings for the company. This accomplishment was
                  pivotal as it marked our shift from a third-party application
                  to our proprietary in-house solution. Our collaboration
                  enabled us to have increased control over the application's
                  features and performance, leading to a more robust and
                  competitive product.

                  Designed, developed, and implemented an in-house CMS
                  application utilizing Java Spring Boot for the backend, MySQL
                  for the database, and Next.js for the frontend. Implemented
                  modern CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitLab for seamless
                  integration and deployment. Orchestrated deployment on Docker
                  and Kubernetes within the GCP cloud platform, optimizing
                  scalability, reliability, and performance.
