          <p>
            I'm Niklas, a passionate software developer based in UmeÃ¥, Sweden.
            With over 4 years of experience, I've been on a journey of crafting
            modern web applications and creating user-friendly interfaces that
            are enjoyed by tens of thousands of users each month.

            One of my proudest accomplishments was leading a project to
            introduce Typescript into a collaborative codebase, where we boosted
            scalability, improved the developer experience, and elevated code
            quality. It was like giving our codebase a supercharge!

            At ComeOn Group, I am part of a fantastic team that built a
            top-notch sports betting application from the ground up, saving the
            company millions by transitioning from a third-party solution. Our
            hard work paid off, resulting in a more stable and competitive
            product.

                  Led an initiative to implement Typescript into a collaborative
                  codebase, resulting in significant improvements in
                  scalability, developer experience, and code quality. This
                  initiative notably reduced the occurrence of critical bugs,
                  and substantial increase in overall product stability and it
                  played a pivotal role in ensuring the quality of our sports
                  betting application.

                  Collaborated closely with my team of developers to
                  successfully launch a large-scale sports betting application,
                  delivering substantial cost savings for the company. This
                  achievement was particularly significant as we transitioned
                  from relying on a third-party application to our in-house
                  solution, which was meticulously crafted by a team of five
                  full-stack developers, including myself. Our collective effort
                  also afforded us greater control over the application's
                  features and performance, ultimately resulting in a more
                  competitive and robust product offering.
