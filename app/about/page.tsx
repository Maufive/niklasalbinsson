            I'm Niklas and I'm a software developer from UmeÃ¥, Sweden. I have a
            particular interest for the frontend web and fun user interactions.
            In my free time I play a lot of video games, I cook and try to spend
            some time outdoors when the weather allows it (Long and cold winters
            up here in UmeÃ¥).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently working as a full stack developer at ComeOn Group,
            where I get to work primarily with Typescript, React and Java. I am
            part of a team where we build a sports betting application and I get
            to work with a lot of fun and challenging problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website is my personal playground where I will sometimes post
            about projects I've worked on or write about stuff I've learned. I
            see it as documenting my career and personal development to have
            something to look back on in the future.
