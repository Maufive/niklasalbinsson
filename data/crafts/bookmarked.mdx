### Project Purpose

I have a personal problem that I was solving with this app. I tend to save links/bookmarks in multiple devices, browsers and apps. So I end up having bookmarks in firefox/chrome/safari and saved posts on my Twitter and Reddit accounts and it makes it annoying when I am looking for a certain link.

It just so happened that Next had just released their new router around the time I started this project and so it was a great opportunity to try it out. And so I did and learned a lot. So much that I gave a presentation about it at work and after posting this I will start to write a blog post about React Server Components and Next 13 specifically.
