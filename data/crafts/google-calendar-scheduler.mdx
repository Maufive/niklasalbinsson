The drag-to-schedule feature in Google Calendar is one of those subtle yet powerful UI interactions that just feels right. It's a perfect blend of utility and delight that transforms a mundane task into a fluid experience. I decided to recreate this interaction using React, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS to understand the nuances that make it so satisfying to use.

## Smooth Interactions

The calendar scheduler features fluid, natural-feeling interactions powered by Framer Motion. When you drag to create a time block, a combination of spring animations and smooth transitions creates that signature Google Calendar feel. The cursor guide uses a subtle gradient that follows your mouse, while the time block itself animates with carefully tuned spring physics for both its position and size. This attention to animation details makes the interaction feel polished and responsive.
