If you've ever been on the popular livestreaming platform [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/) you probably have seen this carousel before. It is used to promote streams that you might not otherwise check out. As a very frequent user of the website I am very familiar with it and thought it would be a fun little side project to see if I would be able to re-create the carousel but using some different tools than they do over at twitch.

  Note: This component is built specifically for desktop, although I made it responsive it
  may not be the best fit for a mobile interface

### Take-aways

This was a really fun project for me personally since I love creating components like these. They tend to look more simple than they actually are! Also I got to play around with the `ResizeObserver` API which I had never done before! This is really something I will be using more often, and will probably try and make a similar hook in my daily work.

As always it's great fun getting to play around with Framer Motion in ways I haven't really used it before.

Some things I was thinking about doing but didn't since it would increase complexitly vastly:

- Gesture navigation
- Supporting variable width items
- A better UI for mobile users

Maybe I will come back to it another day and improve on it but for now I am happy with how it turned out!
