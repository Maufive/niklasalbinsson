### Project Purpose and Goal

I always found the native MacOS emoji picker to be really clunky. The keybind is awkward, I find it difficult to browse different categories and the UI is small and hard to navigate. So I decided to take matters in my own hands to address these issues, while checking out some new tech!

### Project Stack and Explanation

I've been curious about **Electron** for a long time now and finally got a good opportunity to test it out.

This was great to move myself outside of my usual comfort-zone with NextJS where I can just spin up a project and get going with **React**. Instead I chose my own tooling and bundler with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). I was impressed by both of these tools in terms of simplicity to get set up and running my application. In my current job we use webpack which I have had to deal with a few times and it has been all but simple unfortunately.

I am getting more comfortable using **Typescript** and is what I go for straight away these days. I don't really see any point in not using it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Problems and Challanges

The biggest challange with this project was definately working in an environment I am not used to (no browser). The entire **Electron** echosystem is new to me, so figuring out the setup and distubition aspects was probably the most difficult.

I was worried about my large `json` file of emojis and it being slow to search and filter - which is still kind of is. I found that I could use [FuseJS](https://fusejs.io/) to get search speeds with fuzzy search that was good enough for my use-case.

### Lessons Learned

My biggest take-away from this project is definately how powerful Javascript is. I haven't tried **React-Native** yet, but just thinking about how knowing one language allows me to write apps for all platforms. It's really exciting!

I also learned a lot about the more modern React setup and tooling. To get up and running with a simple React app is not as complicated (**at all**) like it used to be when I was just starting out.
