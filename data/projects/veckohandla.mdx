### Project Purpose and Goal

The problem I was trying to solve with this project was the time it takes to put together a complete grocery shopping list. I do my grocery shopping weekly and plan out every meal for the week. This can be quite time consuming to browse through different recipes one by one and compiling them into a list of groceries. So what I wanted was a tool that could show me as many different recipes as I need at the same time, and make it easy for me to compile them into a single list of groceries.

### Project Stack and Explanation

React was the comfortable choice for me for this project. It is what I am most comfortable with. But for this project I wanted to teach my self more about **TypeScript** as it's not something I was very familiar at the time of doing this project. I am comfortable using Redux, but I had never tried Redux Toolkit + RTK Query so I this was a great opportunity to check that out. I was very pleased with the experiance and writing it with TypeScript was pretty straightforward. For the backend parts I decided to go with Prisma as the ORM and MongoDB as the database. Prisma made working with TypeScript a great experiance as it automatically generates the types from the data models.

### Problems and Challanges

The first and pretty obvious problem I ran into straight away was that I need a database of recipes. I wanted a curated list of recipes too, so I didn't want to just take random recipes of the internet that I might never cook anyway. So what I decided to do was to create my own web-scraper script to go visit the URL I pass to it and it would fetch the ingredients I need for that recipe. So I compiled a list of bunch of my favourite recipes that I use and gave it to the scraper.

Another problem that became a big feature in this project was how I was supposed to be able to browse multiple recipes at the same time. This is when I came up with the "shuffle and lock" feature where you can temporarily save the recipes you would like to keep for your grocery list while replacing the ones that aren't as interesting.

### Lessons Learned

While working on this project I learned **a lot** about TypeScript - I got to taste the sweet, sweet intellisense in my IDE. In fact, I got so motivated by this that I started an initiative to get TypeScript into our codebase at my current work. That initiative is still going at the time of writing, and something that has been greatly appriciated among my peers!

I also got to work a little more with Node which is something I rarely get to do. Setting up a new DB and hosting it was something I hadn't done my self before.
